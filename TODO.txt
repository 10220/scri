Implement BMS transformation
  * Tests
    * Trivial construction of grid from modes; test values at points
    * Transformation of scalar
    * Group properties
      * Identity
      * Inverses for each type of transformation
      * Composite of transformations is same as transformation by composite
    * Linear-in-time mode gives rise to constants in other modes
    * Normality of super/translation subgroup
    * Equivalence of rotations with standard Wigner-D method
    * Special case for supertranslation with Psi4, h, etc., as constant zero
    * Special case for boosts using constant [(ell,m)=(2,0)?] mode
    * Any selection rules?
    * Infinitesimal transformations (1e-8)?


Alignments
  * Interpolate fixed waveform to uniform grid within window
  * Interpolate moving waveform to uniform grid 2 or 3 times as large as window
  * Evaluate difference in norms (∆n) for each possible discrete shift δt
  * Find the smallest value of ∆n, look at the two neighboring values, and take the greater
  * Look for all values δt with values of ∆n lower than that maximum
  * Look through all such values of δt, and remove neighbors with larger ∆n
  * Loop over each such point in the following
    * Start with initial delta t given by the above
    * Align the axes using the angular velocities (average directions over time?  value at midpoint?)
    * Rotate about z axis to minimize norm difference using (2*ell+1?) discrete values of rotation angle
    * Optimize explicitly over four degrees of freedom
